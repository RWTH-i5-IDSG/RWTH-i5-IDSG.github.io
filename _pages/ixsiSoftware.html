<p>Aim of this interface specification is the information exchange of information systems for rentals vehicles with travel information systems.
The reason for the information exchange is the requirement of creating intermodal travel chains combining rental services and public transport.
IXSI defines an asynchronous or synchronous data exchange of station information, vehicle information, availabilities, bookings and prices.
Therefore IXSI defines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Role Model</li>
  <li>A Service hierarchy of different qualities of information exchange</li>
  <li>Interaction sequences to explain the order of messages between the partners based on the different service levels</li>
  <li>The data model</li>
  <li>Recommendations for the use of specific technologies for the data exchange and parsing</li>
  <li>Tables of allowed values for enumerations</li>
</ul>
