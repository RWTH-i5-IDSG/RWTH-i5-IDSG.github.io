Aim of the project Mobility Broker was a unifom junction of mobility offers.
Mobility Broker mediates unimodal and intermodal mobility offers based upon the preference of a customer (e.g. travel-time, price, means of transport, etc.).
The front-end of the project is a mobile application, which allows customers to find a appropriate mobility offer.
The foundation of Mobility Broker is a integrated mobility concept for intermodality. 
This mobility concept particularly focuses on the first and the last mile of travel chains and integrates electro mobility.
