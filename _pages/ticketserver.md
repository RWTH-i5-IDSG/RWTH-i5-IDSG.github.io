BarTi allows the issuing of VDV-KA conforming 2D barcode tickets with a static validity. A to the system connected VDV-KA secure access module (SAM), which comes as smartcard, is required. To create the ticket, BarTi offers a RESTful interface accepting the required ticket parameters and returning a signed ticket as picture file, which can be used in e.g., mobile applications.

As VDV-KA is primarly used in Germany, the documentation of BarTi is German.
